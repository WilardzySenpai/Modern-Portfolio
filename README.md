## ÔøΩÔøΩ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js:** (Specify version, e.g., v18 or later). Next.js requires Node.js. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
* **Package Manager:** npm (comes with Node.js), Yarn, pnpm, or Bun.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    *(You still need to provide the URL)*
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd [Your Repository Name]
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    *(Choose the command for your preferred package manager)*
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    # or
    bun install
    ```
3.  **(Optional) Set up environment variables:**
    * **Question:** Does your project require any environment variables (e.g., for a contact form backend, API keys)? If yes, please provide instructions (e.g., copy `.env.example` to `.env` and list the variables needed).

### Running the Development Server

1.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```
2.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
